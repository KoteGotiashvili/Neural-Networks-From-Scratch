## Introducing Neural Networks
Originally known as artificial neural networks, neural networks are computational 
models inspired by the human brain. They consist of interconnected layers of nodes 
or neurons that process data, enabling machines to learn patterns and make decisions.
They find applications in almost everything.
## Coding Our First Neurons
Step-by-step guide to Fully Connected Artificial Neural Network, layers of neurons, 
and operations like dot products and matrix multiplications using pure python. 
For detailed code examples, refer to the [FullyConnectedNN From Scratch](models/FullyConnectedNN.py)

## Adding Layers
Learn how to add and train dense layers in your neural network models. 
Implementing dense layers, which are fully connected layers where each neuron 
receives input from all neurons in the previous layer, has been pivotal in 
deep learning advancements.Dense layers allow for complex pattern 
learning and model flexibility. It is implemented from scratch using Numpy on there [Dense From Scratch](models/Dense.py)

## Activation Functions
**ReLU** - is widely used for its simplicity, computational efficiency, and effectiveness in handling vanishing gradients(Gradients become extremely small) in deep networks. [ReLU From Scratch](activation/ReLU.py)

**SoftMax** - is essential for multi-class classification problems, converting logits(numbers) into probabilities, making it easier to interpret model outputs and compare class scores. [SoftMax From Scratch](activation/SoftMax.py)
## Calculating Network Error with Loss
**Categorical Cross-Entropy** -Categorical cross-entropy loss is widely used in classification tasks, it measures the difference between true and predicted probabilities.It is beneficial for multi-class problems. Lower loss indicates higher confidence in correct predictions (e.g., 0.99 probability yields low loss, approaching zero).
[Categorical Cross-Entropy From Scratch](loss/CategoricalCrossEntropy.py)
## Introducing Optimization
The next step is determining how to adjust the weights and biases 
to decrease the loss. Initially, one might think of changing them randomly, 
but experiments show this is not effective. Instead, 
we use calculus to optimize these adjustments. ðŸ˜Š 

You can see the results after using the random approach

## Derivatives
The random approach does not yield good results. 
Instead, we use calculus, particularly derivatives,
to measure changes in variables. This method involves using the
slopes of functions to optimize our neural networks. Basically we calculate
how much each singular weight and bias change the loss value. For that we are going to
use **Gradient Descent** which is result of the calculation of the partial derivatives and then
we'll **Backpropagate** it using **Chain Rule**.

More About Calculus: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus

## Gradients, Partial Derivatives, and the Chain Rule
**Gradient**: The gradient is a vector consisting of the partial derivatives with respect to each of the inputs.

**Partial Derivatives**: Measures how much impact a single input has on a function's output

If the function is following ![gradient](images/function.png)

Then Partial Derivatives and gradient will be following
![gradient](images/gradient.png) 

**Chain Rule**: The chain rule is used in neural networks during backpropagation 
to compute gradients of the loss function. Loss is a big function
or a chain of functions of multiple inputs.

For instance, if we have two function z=f(x) and y=g(z)
We can represent this equation as y=g(f(x)), As you can see there 
is function inside the function
and as calculus says derivative of y will be y'=g(f(x))' * f(x)' same will be for multi-variable.
